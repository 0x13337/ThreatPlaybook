# ThreatPlaybook - Version 3

> This version is in beta

### Then:
A (relatively) Unopinionated framework that faciliates Threat Modeling as Code married with Application Security Automation on a single Fabric

### Now:
A unified DevSecOps Framework that allows you to go from iterative, collaborative Threat Modeling to Application Security Test Orchestration

> Wait! Weren't you V1 previously, why move to V3 (Version 3)?
The product has changed entirely and is actually three "things" now, so we skipped over a version and it is now Version 3
